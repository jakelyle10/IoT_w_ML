This is a project that reads current distance using the ultrasonic range finder, and also current light level using the light meter. If either go below a given threshold, the buzzer goes off for a few seconds and sends you a text about what kind of issue it detected (motion/ light), then sort of turns off for a while as to not send constant texts or have the buzzer sounding nonstop.
Update: Can't figure out how to shut off the buzzer. Very annoying. Trying to troubleshoot.
